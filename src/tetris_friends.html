          This project was my last project done at DevMountain. It required the use of, REACT, Node.js, PostgreSQL,
          REACT redux, SASS, Socket.io, OAuth, and other extended libraries within REACT. I wanted to show case this
          project because it has been the project I have learned the most from. I really enjoyed directing the team I
          was given and wouldn’t have traded the experience for anything else. This project by far gave me a good
          perspective on how real world web development is like and still encourages me today to continue learning.

            The login page allows users to make a RESTful request to our server after being authorized through OAuth’s hashing, and then is returned their information from the PostgreSQL database. Once having the information it will take the user to the main landing page of the website. Users also have the choice to register, by which they would enter in their first and last name, email, and a user ID in a pop up window created with REACT hooks. We also included a guest feature for users to check out the website before needing to register.

            This is where most of the bulk of the work went to in the project. Tetris itself proved a lot harder to make then I initially thought. Since this is all ran in JavaScript, specifically the REACT framework, every time we make a change to the DOM, it has to “repaint” the entire webpage. Which, if you have ever played Tetris before, the pieces tend to progressively get faster, which is a lot to load for a “lightly built” web page. Along with running into problems with strictness using react router, this took entire days to understand. Further more, after completing a game of tetris, the users score was compared to their previous score to check if it was a highest score for them. Which also checked to see if their highest score beat the leader boards highest score. All in all though, learning about creating my own personal hooks, and having the understanding how state is managed by the DOM and by requests, I wouldn’t trade this experience for anything.

            In summery directing a team with only previous experience in my fraternity did give me anxiety, but with the team I was given it felt as if I was personally managing a small dev team for a company. I learned a lot from this project and couldn’t have done it with my amazing team. I appreciate all of the intricacies, delays, debuggings, problems and solutions that this project offered me.  I can truly say that this project is the reason why I want to continue learning about all kinds of development. Regardless of what framework, language, or even operating system, I can’t wait what is in store for me in the future.
